        img: "images/News/samsungTab.jpg",
        text: "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 has been around for several months now but its 5G version has been stuck in rumorland. Back in October, we saw the tablet obtained certifications from both the Bluetooth SIG as well as the Wi-Fi Alliance and now it was approved by South Korea’s NRRA (National Radio Research Agency). The device is bearing the same SM-T866N model number as the previous listings and the “N” at the end indicates devices that are exclusive for the Korean market. The 5G capable Galaxy Tab S6 will likely debut in South Korea and as of now, it's not clear if it will make its way to international markets later on. All the other specs are expected to be carried over from the regular Tab S6 like the 10.5-inch Super AMOLED QHD+ display, quad speakers and 7,040 mAh battery."

        text: "Huawei has seeded its EMUI 10 to over 1 million devices but it was yet to deliver the new software to its foldable Mate X. Now, that update is getting closer. Huawei has started a beta program for those that want to try out the unfinished EMUI 10 software on their Mate X. As this is a beta software, it's not exactly issue-free so you may not want to install it on your daily driver device. However there are not likely that many Mate X' out in the wild. The device went on sale in China twice, selling out in an instant twice. And it's unlikely that we'll see the Huawei Mate X outside of China soon, if at all. Huawei starts Mate X EMUI 10 beta program EMUI 10 for the Mate X is based on Android 10. It brings a cleaner UI, enhanced dark mode, better UI performance, better gestures, upgraded GPU Turbo and many more features."

        img: "images/News/XiaomiSales.jpg",
        text: "Xiaomi officially launched the Redmi Note 8 lineup on August 29. The Redmi Note 8 and Redmi Note 8 Pro started selling almost immediately and just three months later the manufacturer sold 10 million units across the globe. To celebrate the massive accomplishment, the company is discounting the Redmi Note 8 on its website, but it is just the 6/128 GB option and only in China. The milestone is impressive on its own, but it is even more remarkable when it is compared with the Redmi Note7 sale - the current midrangers went into the eight-digit amount in just three months - almost 30 days faster than its predecessors. It also announced that it was selling about 110,000 units per day, every day, for three months. With this milestone now behind its back, Xiaomi says it will focus on the Redmi K30 announcement, scheduled for tomorrow. We are expecting the first 5G device of the sub-brand, along with a full-screen experience and punch-hole design with dual cameras. We are likely going to see a Redmi K30 and Redmi K30 Pro, with only the latter supporting next-gen connectivity and probably quicker fast-charging options."

        text: "After a few months of collaboration, the Apple Pay Express Transit feature now works for all Transport for London services, including the Underground, buses and trams – anywhere there is a yellow reader. Basically, if you have an iPhone or an Apple Watch, you can now leave your Oyster card behind.To start using the Express Transit feature, you just need to pick a preferred card to use for payments. The “express” part of the name means that the usual authentication is skipped to make it faster to use. Interestingly, this feature will continue working for up to five hours after your iPhone’s battery dies – however, this only applies to iPhone XS, XR and newer models. Also keep in mind that powering off the phone disables the Transit feature. Note that authentication is still required for regular Apple Pay transactions. And if you lose your phone or watch, you can disable the Express Transit feature remotely. Apple Pay Express Transit now works in London. This feature is available for the public transport services in several other regions, including New York (MTA), Portland (TriMet), Japan (Suica cards) as well as Beijing and Shanghai."

This project is a collaboration between Apple, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook and the goal is to make it easier for you to transfer data between their ecosystems. Facebook now allows you to export all your pictures to Google Photos. As of now, Facebook says the open-source tool to transfer your photos is only available to some users in Ireland but will be introduced to the rest of the world in early 2020. Facebook also adds that the tool will work with other services and it's easy to guess which are on the top priority list - iCloud and OneDrive."
